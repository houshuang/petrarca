## What Was Built

On March 8, 2026, the full knowledge-aware reading system was implemented end-to-end based on the design in `research/novelty-system-architecture.md` and validated by 11 experiments documented in `research/experiment-results-report.md`. Subsequently, the full 171-article corpus was restored with claims, embeddings, and knowledge index, and a cost auditing system was added.

### Architecture Overview

The system splits into **server-computed INDEX** (user-independent) and **client-side LEDGER** (user-specific):

```
Server Pipeline (cron every 4 hours):
  Twitter + Readwise → build_articles.py --claims → atomic claims (parallel, 10 workers)
  → build_claim_embeddings.py → Gemini embedding-001 (batch 100)
  → build_knowledge_index.py → knowledge_index.json (parallel delta reports, 10 workers)
  → All calls tracked by llm_audit.py → data/llm_audit.jsonl

App (Expo SDK 54):
  content-sync.ts downloads knowledge_index.json
  → knowledge-engine.ts classifies claims against user's ledger
  → paragraph dimming, curiosity scoring, delta reports
  → AsyncStorage persists knowledge ledger (@petrarca/knowledge_ledger)
  → All interactions logged via logger.ts → local + server (port 8091)
```

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app/data/knowledge-engine.ts` | Core knowledge engine — FSRS decay, claim classification, paragraph dimming, curiosity scoring, knowledge ledger persistence. Module-level state (singleton). |
| `app/data/queue.ts` | Reading queue with AsyncStorage persistence. Add/remove/list queued article IDs. |
| `app/app/(tabs)/topics.tsx` | Topics screen — articles grouped by broad topic, expandable clusters with delta report summaries and top claims. |
| `app/app/(tabs)/queue.tsx` | Queue screen — saved-for-later articles with swipe-to-remove. |
| `scripts/build_knowledge_index.py` | Server pipeline — loads articles + embeddings, computes cosine similarity matrix, extracts cross-article pairs, builds paragraph mappings, generates LLM delta reports (parallel, 10 workers). Outputs `data/knowledge_index.json`. |
| `scripts/deploy_knowledge_index.sh` | Deploys knowledge_index.json to nginx + updates manifest hash. Supports `--local` mode. |
| `scripts/llm_audit.py` | Thread-safe JSONL audit trail for all LLM calls. Tracks tokens, cost, cache hits per-call. CLI: `python3 scripts/llm_audit.py --days 7`. |
| `scripts/log_server.py` | HTTP server (port 8091) for collecting app interaction logs. Accepts POST /log with JSONL body, stores as daily files in `/opt/petrarca/data/logs/`. |

#### Modified Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/data/types.ts` | Added 9 types: `KnowledgeIndex`, `DeltaReport`, `NoveltyClassification`, `ClaimKnowledgeEntry`, `ClaimClassification`, `ParagraphDimming`, `ArticleNovelty` |
| `app/data/content-sync.ts` | Downloads `knowledge_index.json` alongside articles. Added `KNOWLEDGE_INDEX_URL`, `knowledge_index_hash` to manifest checking, graceful fallback if index doesn't exist. |
| `app/data/store.ts` | Imports and initializes knowledge engine + queue in `initStore()`. Exports wrapper functions. Added bundled fallback `require('./knowledge_index.json')`. |
| `app/app/reader.tsx` | 3 reading modes (Full/Guided/New Only), paragraph dimming via `blockDimming` map, collapsible familiar sections (`CollapsedBar` component), "What's new for you" claims card, `ReadingModeToggle` component, `buildParagraphToBlockMap()` for mapping pipeline paragraph indices to markdown block indices. Calls `markArticleEncountered()` on Done. |
| `app/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` | Curiosity-zone re-ranking (with 0.05 threshold for stability), topic filter chips (horizontal ScrollView), swipe-right-to-queue, novelty hints ("N new claims"), `ContinueReadingCard` component (limited to 2 most recent). Interaction logging for swipe-dismiss and swipe-queue. |
| `app/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` | 3-tab layout: Feed / Topics / Queue. Text-only labels (EB Garamond), rubric dot active indicator. |
| `app/data/logger.ts` | Dual-write logging: local (localStorage/filesystem) + server buffer (batched POST to port 8091 every 5s). |
| `scripts/content-refresh.sh` | Full 6-step pipeline: fetch sources → build articles → validate → extract entities → extract claims → embed claims → build knowledge index → copy to nginx. |

## Known Issues & Bugs

### UI Issues (from user screenshot, Mar 8)

1. **Filter chips row clipped** — **RESOLVED**: Changed `maxHeight: 40` to `flexGrow: 0`.
2. **Continue Reading section too large** — **RESOLVED**: Limited to 2 most recent.
3. **Continue Reading cards have card-like backgrounds** — **RESOLVED**: Removed parchmentDark background.
4. ~~**UI not visually tested**~~ — **RESOLVED**: Visual testing done with agent-browser. Confirmed all screens render correctly. Topics expansion works (Playwright click issue was a false positive — React Native Web Pressable needs DOM `.click()`, not Playwright's `click @ref`).

### Data Issues

5. ~~**Server has only 47 articles**~~ — **RESOLVED**: Full 171-article corpus restored with 2,954 atomic claims, embeddings, and knowledge index.
6. ~~**Duplicate topic variants**~~ — **RESOLVED**: Added client-side topic normalization in `app/lib/display-utils.ts` (`normalizeTopic()` + `displayTopic()`). Used across feed filter chips, topic tags, and Topics tab grouping. Reduced 67→58 topic groups.
7. **google.generativeai deprecation warning** — Embedding script uses deprecated `google.generativeai` package, should migrate to `google.genai`.

### Logic Issues

8. **Reading mode toggle shows even when no dimming** — Fixed: now checks `Array.from(blockDimming.values()).some(d => d.opacity < 1)`.
9. **Feed sort unstable with empty ledger** — Fixed: added 0.05 threshold + rank tiebreaker so interest model order is preserved until curiosity scores meaningfully diverge.
10. **Paragraph-to-block mapping is heuristic** — `buildParagraphToBlockMap()` uses text prefix matching (first 50 chars). May mismap in articles with repeated paragraph openings.

---

## How the Knowledge System Works (User Perspective)

### First Use (Empty Ledger)
1. All claims classify as NEW (no ledger entries to compare against)
2. Feed shows articles ranked by interest model (curiosity scoring has no effect yet)
3. Reader shows "What's new for you" card with novel claims from the knowledge index
4. Reading mode toggle does NOT appear (no familiar blocks to dim)
5. User reads article → Done → claims recorded in ledger with stability=30d

### After Reading Several Articles
1. Open an article on a related topic → knowledge engine finds similar claims via cosine similarity
2. Claims matching ledger entries at ≥0.78 → KNOWN, ≥0.68 → EXTENDS, <0.68 → NEW
3. Paragraph dimming computed: familiar paragraphs get opacity 0.55, novel get 1.0, mixed get blended
4. Reading mode toggle appears:
   - **Full** — all content at normal opacity
   - **Guided** — familiar paragraphs dimmed (opacity from dimming map)
   - **New Only** — familiar blocks collapsed into "N familiar sections" bars, tap to expand
5. Feed re-ranks: articles with ~70% novelty ratio score highest (curiosity zone)

### Knowledge Decay
- Claims fade over time: R = e^(-t/S) where S = stability_days
- Skim=9d, Read=30d, Highlight=60d
- Re-reading reinforces: stability × 2.5
- Forgotten when R < 0.3 → claim treated as unknown again

### Topics & Delta Reports
- Topics tab groups articles by broad topic from `interest_topics`
- Expanding a topic shows the LLM-generated delta report: "What's new in [topic]"
- Delta reports are pre-generated by `build_knowledge_index.py` using Gemini Flash
- Each report: summary paragraph + top 5 claims

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (before daily use)
1. ~~**Visual testing**~~ — **DONE**: All screens verified via agent-browser.
2. ~~**Topic normalization**~~ — **DONE**: Client-side normalization in `display-utils.ts`, deployed.
3. **Production bundle optimization** — Remove bundled `knowledge_index.json` from JS (now 4.3MB — load from server only, cache in AsyncStorage)

### Short-term (quality improvements)
4. **Incremental embedding** — `build_claim_embeddings.py` currently re-embeds all claims. Should detect new claims and only embed those (append to existing .npz).
5. **LLM judge for ambiguous range** — Claims with 0.68-0.78 cosine similarity get LLM verification (cosine overestimates in this range)
6. **Sub-topic splitting** — Use embedding clusters for broad topics like "Sicily" (110 claims) that are too general for useful delta reports
7. **Migrate to `google.genai`** — Replace deprecated `google.generativeai` in embedding script

### Medium-term (feature completion)
8. **Micro-delights** — Pull-to-refresh ✦ ornament, claim reveal animations, completion flash (from design spec)
9. **Entry row sidebar** — Design system calls for 76px sidebar with large numbers + depth dots (not yet implemented in feed)
10. **Research agent button** — Capture ideas while reading → spawn background research agents
11. **Voice notes** — Record → Soniox transcription → link to reading context

### Longer-term
12. **Contradiction detection** — Current corpus too harmonious (mostly tech blogs). Needs diverse sources. Experiment showed 0 real contradictions in current data.
13. **Web clipper** — Browser extension for capturing articles (see `research/ingestion-sources.md`)
14. **Book reader** — Section-based long-form reading with cross-book connections (see `research/book-reader-design.md`)
